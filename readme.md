# django-react-docker

## a template setup environment for webapp
- backend: [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) v4
- frontend: react v18 - [vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) (reactjs + swc)

## both backend and frontend are in their separate container
idea is to connect them via API calls


## TODOs
- database: will be added for the backend later either of the popular choices
    - nosql db: mongodb
    - relational db: postgreqs or mysql
- default db is provided by django is sqlite3
